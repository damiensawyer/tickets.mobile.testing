# Themes
The Phone was white, but the browser was black. 
[See](https://stackoverflow.com/a/62610393/494635)
Changed variable.css
Note that, out of the box, a setting of 'light' would be light on the browser but dark on the phone. The opposite for black. 

## Generating Themes
I used [this](https://ionicframework.com/docs/theming/color-generator) to generate a pallete in our colours. 
I copied it into two places in variables.css, one for light and one for dark. See commit 2f77e17
